Unlike many other frameworks, PageCarton Plugins doesn't really need to be created with codes. In fact, PageCarton plugins are built using a Graphic Interface. Now, the built plugins may now contain widgets, templates, etc which are created with codes but the way PageCarton plugins work make it simply to create and use.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The concept of PageCarton plugins is to pack some components of a site in a way that it could be integrated into another website. So when a Plugin is built on Site A, it includes certain components - files, pages and other resources so that when such plugin is installed and activated on Site B, all the resources are available on site B just like they were originally on Site B. The moment the plugin is deactivated on Site B, the site go back to the way it was before the plugin was installed - without the components and functionalities introduced by the plugin built on Site A.
