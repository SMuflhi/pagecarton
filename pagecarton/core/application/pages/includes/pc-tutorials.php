More advanced methods are covered in other documentations articles and forums. Content on this website is categorized into three different types:<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Branding Content<br>
	<br>
	This includes logo, icons, banners, site title and descriptions. This is also where the site theme type is set.&nbsp;The content here are not expected to change frequently. On most cases, the things set here are never changed.&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li><a class="pc-btn" href="/pc-admin/Application_Personalization" target="_blank">Update Branding Content</a><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Static Content<br>
	<br>
	This contains some information some other content that may not change frequently but are&nbsp;likely to change more often than Branding Content. Examples are content of the About Us section, contact information etc. Basically, the items in this category are not related to one another. Static images are the photos on the website that can be easily replaced with new ones.<br>
	&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li><a class="pc-btn" href="/pc-admin/Ayoola_Page_Layout_ReplaceText" target="_blank">Update Static Text Content</a>&nbsp;</li>

	<li>Dynamic Content<br>
	<br>
	Dynamic contents are called "posts" because they do have related characteristics like titles, descriptions and image. Dynamic site content on PageCarton sites are content that are expected to change frequently. In fact, it allows one to add new dynamic content more frequently so that they could replace the old content on the website. When new dynamic content are added, they don\'t delete the old ones, the old ones may just be taken off the home page but they are also archived and can be accessed by search engines. This is a great way to build up site content to have a lot of information about the organization. Example dynamic contents are blog posts, event &amp; news, testimonials, products &amp; services etc. Dynamic content also have dynamic categories which can be easily updated<br>
	&nbsp;

		<br>
		Display Name: Your full name<br>
		Profile description: A profile description for yourself<br>
		Profile URL: Url would be the page to create for your content like {{{pc_domain}}}/example&nbsp;<br>
		<br>

		"Article Content" would be text information of the content.&nbsp;<br>
		"Cover Photo" would be the image that would accompany the content as the main photo<br>
		<br>
